# RCP208

During my scolarship at CNAM in France, I have the opportunity to study machine learning, artificial intelligence and other statistical learning related topics during the RCP208 subject taught in the school.

This repository contains a collection of course exercises taht we are given during this subject. The exercises cover various concepts, algorithms, and techniques used in these exciting fields.

The repository will be updated throughout the rest of my scolarship, until the subject is finished.
